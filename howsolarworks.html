            <h1>Solar panels</h1>
            <p>
              Simply put, a solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles
              of light, to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of
              electricity. Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units
              called photovoltaic cells. (Photovoltaic simply means they convert
              sunlight into electricity.) Many cells linked together make up a
              solar panel. Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made
              up of two slices of semi-conducting material, usually silicon ‚Äî
              the same stuff used in microelectronics.

            <h1>Charge controller</h1>
            <p>
              A charge controller or charge regulator is basically a voltage
              and/or current regulator to keep batteries from overcharging. It
              regulates the voltage and current coming from the solar panels
              going to the battery. Most but not all 12 volt panels put out
              about 16 to 20 volts, so if there is no regulation the batteries
              will be damaged from overcharging. Most batteries need around 14
              to 14.5 volts to get fully charged.

            <h1>Battery system</h1>
            <p>
              Battery storage systems generally consist of three main
              components. a battery which contains individual battery cells
              wired together, capable of discharging and being charged with DC
              voltage. inverter-charger unit which is capable of converting DC
              electricity from the battery to AC electricity and converting AC
              to DC for charging the battery from mains power. balance of system
              components such as wiring, battery management systems and other
              measurement and control components such as meters and switches.

            <h1>DC power</h1>
            <p>
              Direct current or DC electricity is the continuous movement of
              electrons from an area of negative charges to an area of positive.
              A DC circuit is necessary to allow the current or steam of
              electrons to flow. Such a circuit consists of a source of electric
              energy (such as a battery) and a conducting wire running from the
              positive end of the source to the negative terminal. DC
              electricity in a circuit consists of voltage, current and
              resistance. The flow of DC electricity is similar to the flow of
              water through a hose.

            <h1>Inventer</h1>
            <p>
              A inverter plays an essential role like a brain. The main function
              of this is to alter DC power to AC power which is generated from
              the solar array. Inverters convert direct current (DC) energy
              which is generated from the solar panels into usable alternating
              current (AC) energy. This current can be used for different
              applications like in a viable electrical grid otherwise off-grid
              electrical network. These inverters have some functions with PV
              arrays like tracking of utmost PowerPoint & protection of
              anti-islanding.

            <h1>AC power</h1>
            <p>
              Alternating current describes the flow of charge that changes
              direction periodically. As a result, the voltage level also
              reverses along with the current. AC is used to deliver power to
              houses, office buildings, etc. AC can be produced using a device
              called an alternator. This device is a special type of electrical
              generator designed to produce alternating current. AC can come in
              a number of forms, as long as the voltage and current are
              alternating.
